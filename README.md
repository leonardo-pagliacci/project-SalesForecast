# Project - Sales Forecast

This README file outlines the workflow for a project aimed at predicting sales using past sales data. The project involves several key steps, including data reading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. Each step is detailed below.

## Step 1: Reading the Data

The process begins by importing necessary libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and custom EDA functions. Two datasets are read into DataFrames: past sales data and future data for which sales predictions are required.

## Step 2: Data Analysis

Initial analysis includes viewing summaries of the datasets using custom functions like `standard_head()` and `analyze_data()`, which provide insights into the data's structure and content.

## Step 3: Cleaning Operations

Cleaning involves creating new columns based on the 'date' column (month, year, week, day) to facilitate detailed analysis. Additionally, records where stores are closed or no customers are present are filtered out as they are not useful for predicting sales.

## Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focuses on understanding sales trends, particularly how sales correlate with store open status, state holidays, promotions, and other features. This involves visualizing data distributions, identifying outliers, and analyzing feature correlations with sales.

## Step 5: Feature Engineering

Feature engineering enhances the dataset with new features, such as interactions between customers and promotions, binning customer numbers, and calculating average payments by customers. These engineered features aim to improve model accuracy by providing more relevant information for predicting sales.

## Step 6: Machine Learning Modeling

Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and CatBoost. Each model is assessed using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The best-performing model(s) based on these metrics are selected for final predictions.

### Final Model and Predictions

After extensive experimentation, CatBoost emerges as the chosen model due to its performance. A significant step involves training individual CatBoost models for each store to capture unique sales patterns. Final predictions for future sales are made using these models.

## Step 7: Output Preparation

Predictions are merged with the future data to align with the required output format. Predicted sales are filled for missing entries (where no predictions could be made), ensuring the final dataset is complete.

## Step 8: Exporting Predictions

The final step involves exporting the predictions to an Excel file, making it ready for submission or further analysis.

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Preprocessing**: Proper cleaning and preparation of data are crucial for effective modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creatively engineered features can significantly enhance model performance by providing more nuanced insights into the data.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Testing multiple models and rigorously evaluating their performance ensures the selection of the best model for the task.
- **Individualized Modeling**: Training separate models for different segments of the data (e.g., by store) can improve accuracy by capturing unique trends and patterns.
